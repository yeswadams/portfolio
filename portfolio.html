    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm Adams Yeswa, an aspiring software engineer with a background in marketing. After getting my business degree, I worked in various marketing roles where I enjoyed the strategic thinking but wanted to go deeper into the technical side. This prompted me to start learning to code through online courses and build web applications as side projects. I was immediately hooked by the challenge and creativity of programming.

        I decided to pivot into software development and enrolled in an intensive full-stack coding bootcamp while still working my marketing job. It was a demanding balancing act, but confirmed this was the career change I wanted to make. I'm now looking to leverage my diverse business and marketing experience as I transition into a software engineering role.
        
        In my spare time, I continue sharpening my programming skills by building projects, contributing to open source, and learning about new technologies. I'm excited to combine my technical abilities with my marketing insights to build solutions that provide real value.</p>
